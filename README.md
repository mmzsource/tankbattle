# Tank Battle

This shooter is meant as a fun game for team building and for learning to work
with a REST API.

- Hand out the quick reference cards to a party (group or person)
- Let the party experience the REST API via the simulation environment
  (basically send a world-state AND a command and get back the new world-state)
- Give the parties limited time to program the tanks to win battles
- When two or more parties subscribe to the game, the tank battle can start
- Hands of the keyboard during the battle!

## Installation

The running environment minimally contains:

- 1 server
- 1 (big) screen rendering a playgound
- 2 REST API clients
- a network connecting the server and clients

## Usage

## Examples

clojure, etc.
